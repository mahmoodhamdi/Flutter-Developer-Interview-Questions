مَن قالَ: لا إلَهَ إلَّا اللَّهُ، وحْدَهُ لا شَرِيكَ له، له المُلْكُ وله الحَمْدُ، وهو علَى كُلِّ شَيءٍ قَدِيرٌ، في يَومٍ مِئَةَ مَرَّةٍ؛ كانَتْ له عَدْلَ عَشْرِ رِقابٍ، وكُتِبَتْ له مِئَةُ حَسَنَةٍ، ومُحِيَتْ عنْه مِئَةُ سَيِّئَةٍ، وكانَتْ له حِرْزًا مِنَ الشَّيْطانِ يَومَهُ ذلكَ حتَّى يُمْسِيَ، ولَمْ يَأْتِ أحَدٌ بأَفْضَلَ ممَّا جاءَ به، إلَّا أحَدٌ عَمِلَ أكْثَرَ مِن ذلكَ.
