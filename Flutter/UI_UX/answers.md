# Flutter UI/UX : Answers

## 1. What are the basic principles of Material Design?

Material Design is based on five core principles:

- **Material as Metaphor**: Uses visual cues from paper and ink.
- **Bold, Graphic, Intentional**: Emphasizes large-scale typography and imagery.
- **Motion Provides Meaning**: Animations guide the user and indicate changes.
- **Adaptive Design**: Ensures responsiveness across devices.
- **User-Centric**: Focuses on creating intuitive user experiences.

## 2. How do you implement responsive design in Flutter?

Responsive design in Flutter can be achieved through:

- **LayoutBuilder**: Adjusts layout based on parent constraints.
- **MediaQuery**: Provides screen dimensions to adapt UI.
- **Flexible and Expanded widgets**: Manage space allocation dynamically.
- **AspectRatio**: Maintains proportionality of UI elements.

## 3. What is the LayoutBuilder, and how is it used?

LayoutBuilder is a widget that builds itself based on the parent widget's constraints. It allows developers to create responsive layouts by providing the available width and height, enabling conditional layout rendering.

## 4. How do you create custom themes in Flutter?

Custom themes can be created using the `ThemeData` class:
```dart
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    primaryColor: Colors.blue,
    accentColor: Colors.amber,
    textTheme: TextTheme(bodyText1: TextStyle(color: Colors.black)),
  ),
);
```

You can then use `Theme.of(context)` to access theme properties throughout the app.

## 5. What is the difference between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget?

- **StatelessWidget**: Immutable, builds once and does not change state. Ideal for static UI components.
- **StatefulWidget**: Mutable, can rebuild itself when its state changes, suitable for interactive UI.

## 6. How do you use MediaQuery for responsive layouts?

MediaQuery provides information about the size and orientation of the screen. Use it to adapt layout:

```dart
final size = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
final width = size.width;
```
