    Use middleware or API gateway features to limit the number of requests a user can make in a specified time period to prevent abuse.

22. **What are some best practices for managing user passwords?**  
    Enforce strong password policies, use hashing with salt, and implement password expiration and recovery mechanisms.

23. **How do you prevent data leakage in your app?**  
    Avoid storing sensitive data in plaintext, implement secure storage, and restrict access to sensitive information.

24. **How can you protect your app against man-in-the-middle attacks?**  
    Use SSL/TLS for secure communication and validate server certificates to ensure that data is not intercepted.

25. **What is cross-site scripting (XSS), and how can you prevent it?**  
    XSS is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject scripts into web pages. Prevent it by sanitizing user inputs and escaping outputs.

26. **How do you log sensitive data securely?**  
    Avoid logging sensitive information like passwords or tokens, and use secure logging mechanisms with restricted access.

27. **What is the principle of least privilege?**  
    This principle states that users and systems should have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks, reducing security risks.

28. **How do you implement session expiration in your app?**  
    Set expiration times for user sessions and prompt users to re-authenticate when their session expires.

29. **What is the role of flutter_webview_plugin in app security?**  
    It allows you to display web content securely within your app, but developers must ensure that they handle sensitive data appropriately.

30. **How do you handle sensitive information in error logs?**  
    Avoid logging sensitive information and use generic error messages to prevent information disclosure.

31. **What is code obfuscation, and how is it implemented?**  
    Code obfuscation transforms readable code into a more complex version, making it harder to reverse engineer. In Flutter, tools like ProGuard can be used.

32. **How do you handle user permissions securely?**  
    Request only the permissions necessary for your app's functionality and educate users about why those permissions are needed.
